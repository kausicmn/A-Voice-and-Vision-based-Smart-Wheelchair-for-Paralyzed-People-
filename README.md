# A-Voice-and-Vision-based-Smart-Wheelchair-for-Paralyzed-People-

This project mainly focuses on developing an eye ball movement and voice command based wheel chair controller for paralyzed people using Raspberry Pi. The movement of the eye ball is tracked using Open CV (haar cascade algorithm), and the motor driver controls the direction of the wheel chair based on pupil location. The voice module receives user feedback through an android application in mobile. In the event of an emergency, people may send a message to their guardian through voice command via the message module through the android app.
